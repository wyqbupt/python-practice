A short history of the company
</h2>
<h2>
World Wide Spam was started in the summer of 2000. The business
</h2>
<h2>
concept was to ride the dot-com wave and to make money both through
</h2>
<h2>
bulk email and by selling canned meat online.
</h2>
<h2>
After receiving several complaints from customers who weren't
</h2>
<h2>
satisfied by their bulk email, World Wide Spam altered their profile,
</h2>
<h2>
and focused 100% on canned goods. Today, they rank as the world's
</h2>
<h2>
13,892nd online supplier of SPAM.
